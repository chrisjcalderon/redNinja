<h3>Site and Administrator</h3>
<p>Your site actually has two separate sites. The site (also called the front end) is what visitors to your site will see. The administrator (also called the back end) is only used by people managing your site. You can access the administrator by clicking the "Site Administrator" link on the "This Site" menu or by adding /administrator to the end of you domain name.</p>
<p>Log in to the administrator using the username and password created during the installation of Joomla.</p>
